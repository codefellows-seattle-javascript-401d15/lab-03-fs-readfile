##Lab03 Overview

###Learning Objectives

1. gain exposure to asynchronous testing in JS
2. further understanding of context
3. implementing Chai library as a way to make tests more human-readable

###Biggest Roadblocks

1. understanding where to put callbacks, and trying to wrap my head around the ambiguity of their parameters
2. understanding how to write *useful* tests that don't generate false positives
3. continuing to understand the modular testing pattern in general (requiring in modules, attaching objects/functions as exports, etc.)
