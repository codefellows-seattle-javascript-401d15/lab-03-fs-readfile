A standard 1000 word essay example is an essay on the given topic or a topic of your own choice (in case your professor or tutor did not give you any). The number of 1000 word essay pages should be one or two A4 sheets, not more, so maybe it is not as much as you think. Producing a written work requires formal preparation, but before you formally prepare, gather your thoughts on the subject and think about what you really know. In order to be successful at writing essays, you need to know enough about the topic and simply present your own thoughts rather than trying to write what they expect you to write. You need to have your own thoughts and your own opinion about the matter, in that case writing should not present such a difficulty. Research the topic using multiple online and library resources, or simply read 1000 word essay example on the Internet, and shape your own opinion. This way, it will be much easier for you to deal with the task.

Getting down to writing

When you get round to a writing task, like writing a rhetorical analysis essay or writing a 1000 words essay, you should plan your writing thoroughly. A rule of thumb in writing essays is addressing your task 100%. This includes not only writing what they ask you to write, but also not writing whatever they don’t ask you to write. It means that the writing should be strictly on topic. Once you understand what is needed from you, you will be limited in your task, and thus will not lose yourself in the huge number of ideas you want to cover in the essay, and at the same time will know exactly what to write about.

When you understand the task, prepare an outline of your essay. Any 1000 word essay example on the Internet and in other reliable sources on writing suggests that the structure of the essay should be basic and include the following:

the introduction (2-3 sentences)
the main body, consisting of 2 or 3 body paragraphs, 3-4 sentences each
the conclusion (2-3 sentences)
